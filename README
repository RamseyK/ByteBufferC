# ByteBufferC

A port of my [C++ ByteBuffer](https://github.com/RamseyK/ByteBufferCpp) to provide Java's ByteBuffer functionality. Feel free to make any suggestions for improving the code or request any features that could be beneficial to a variety of applications that may use this class.

## Why Byte Buffer?
* Relative and Absolute get() & put() methods
* Easier to work with than a raw byte array
* Read and Write large amounts of data
* Easy way to manipulate or create custom data structures

## Example Program:
* dd_reader, a MBR / FAT Disk Image Parser: https://github.com/RamseyK/dd_reader
